# To Do List for the Electronic Structure Project

The project consists of a set of tools to post-process the DFT (from Quantum Espresso) and Wannier (from Wannier90) results, and to further perform quantum transport calculations.

1. Generate Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid for Brillouin zone integration... done
2. Read Wannier90 output file `seedname_hr.dat`... done
3. Fourier transform the Wannier Hamiltonian to reciprocal space... done
4. Calculate bandstructure... done
5. TO DO: Calculate velocity operator components in k-space
6. TO DO: Calculate spin current operator components in k-space
7. TO DO: Calculate the bands Berry curvature
