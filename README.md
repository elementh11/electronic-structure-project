# Electronic Structure Project

This project consists of a set of tools to post-process the DFT (from Quantum Espresso) and Wannier (from Wannier90) results, and to further perform quantum transport calculations.

Current capabilities

- Generate Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid for Brillouin zone integration
- Read Wannier90 output file `seedname_hr.dat`
- Fourier transform the Wannier Hamiltonian to reciprocal space
- Calculate bandstructure... done
