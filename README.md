# Electronic Structure Project

This project consists of a set of tools to post-process the DFT (from Quantum Espresso) and Wannier (from Wannier90) calculations, and to further perform quantum transport calculations.

To Do:

1. Generate Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid for Brillouin zone integration... done
2. Read Wannier90 output file `seedname_hr.dat`... done
3. Fourier transform the Wannier Hamiltonian to reciprocal space... done
4. Calculate bandstructure... done
5. Calculate velocity operator
